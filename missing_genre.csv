(The heart trembles with every plead, The eyes are scared stiff to weep),Aisi Ulfat Se Woh Jaate Jaate Bhul Jane Ke Liye, Mujh Ko Apni Kasam De Gaye Hain. (Such was the love that as they left, They made a promise to forget me in return),Meri Aankhoon Ko Bakhshe Hain Aansu, Dil Ko Daag-e-Alam De Gai Hain.

But when they do, they say they are Going to free all the animals from their cages, No matter how new or modern, Even some pets, too. So if on your way home today, You happen to find...,A baboon basking in the balcony, Or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby, Or a python perched in the pantry, A wildebeest in the W.C., With a turtle twirling in your tub, Don't be afraid, just say your a friend, Of their friend.,Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua Joshua Giraffe, Joshua, Joshua (Who hoo)"

It's time you wake up, the coffee is getting cold, and the poisoned food has grown mold The Fourth Reich runs the FDA, the Fed, and with malice they legislate. The elite rich from the bible days still run the world today. But wait... Then one day I woke up, and I could see... The only hope now lays within you and me.

With the thoughts I'd be thinkin' I could be another Lincoln If I only had a brain. Oh, I could tell you why The ocean's near the shore. I could think of things I never thunk before. And then I'd sit, and think some more. I would not be just a nuffin' my head all full of stuffin' My heart all full of pain. I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry, If I only had a brain.,Heart,When a man's an empty kettle he should be on his mettle, And yet I'm torn apart. Just because I'm presumin' that I could be kind-a-human, If I only had heart. I'd be tender - I'd be gentle and awful sentimental Regarding Love and Art. I'd be friends with the sparrows ... and the boys who shoots the arrows If I only had a heart. Picture me - a balcony. Above a voice sings low. Wherefore art thou, Romeo? I hear a beat.... How sweet. Just to register emotion, jealousy - devotion, And really feel the part. I could stay young and chipper and I'd lock it with a zipper, If I only had a heart.,The Nerve,Life is sad, believe me, Missy, When you're born to be a sissy Without the vim and verve. But I could change my habits, never more be scared of rabbits If I only had the nerve. I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dandelion, A fate I don't deserve. But I could show my prowess, be a lion not a mowess If I only had the nerve Oh I'd be in my stride, a king down to the core I would roar the way I've never roared before And then I'd rrrwoof! and roar some more I would show the dinosaurus who's king around the forres' A king they better serve Why with my regal beezer I could be another Caesar If I only had the nerve"

So we'd like you to keep your promise to us - if you please, sir. Wizard Not so fast! Not so fast! I'll have to give the matter a little thought! Go away and come back tomorrow! Dorothy Tomorrow! Oh, but I want to go home now! Wizard Do not arouse the wrath of the Great and Powerful Oz! I said come back tomorrow! Oh! The Great Oz has spoken! Oh!

I'm just a very bad Wizard. Scarecrow What about the heart that you promised the Tin Man? Wizard Well, I - Scarecrow And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion? Wizard Well, I - Tin Man and Lion And Scarecrow's brain? Wizard Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a very mediocre commodity. Back where I come from we have universities - seats of great learning - where men go to become great thinkers. And when they come out, they think deep thoughts, and with no more brains than you have. But - they have one thing you haven't got - a diploma! Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universita Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D. Scarecrow Th.D.? Wizard Yeah - that - that's Dr. of Thinkology Scarecrow How can I ever thank you enough? Wizard Well, you can't! As for you my fine friend, you are a victim or disorganized thinking. You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger you have no courage! You are confusing courage with wisdom. Back where I come fro mwe have men who are called heroes. Once a year they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city. And they have no more courage than you have. But - they have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!! Therefore, for meritorious conduct, extraordinary valor, conspicuous bravery against wicked witches, I award you the Triple Cross. You are now a member of the Legion of Courage! Lion Oh - oh, shucks, folks - I'm speechless! Wizard As for you, my galvanized friend - you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. Tin Man But I - I still want one. Wizard Back where I come from there are men who do nothing all day but good deeds. They are called phil....er.....phil...er...er....good-deed-doers and their hearts are no bigger than yours, but they have one thing you haven't got! A testimonial! Therefore, in consideration of your kindness, I take pleasure at this time in presenting you with a small token of our esteem and affection. And remember, my sentimental friend, that a heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others. Tin Man Oh, Oh, it ticks! Listen! Look, it ticks! Lion Read - read what my medal says. Courage! Ain't it the truth! Dorothy Oh - oh they're all wonderful. Scarecrow Hey, what about Dorothy? Dorothy Oh, I don't think there's anything in that black bag for me. Wizard Well - you force me into a cataclysmic decision. The only way to get Dorothy back to Kansas is for me to take her there myself! Dorothy Oh! Oh, will you? Could you? Oh! Oh, but are you a clever enough wizard to manage it? Wizard Child, you cut me to the quick! I'm an old Kansas man myself, born and bred - in the heart of the western wilderness, premier Baloonist, highest class. And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the Land of E Pluribus Unum! This is positivey the finest exhibition ever to be shown.....well, be that as it may. I, your Wizard, par adua outer, am about to embark on a hazardous and technically unexplainable journey into the outer stratosphere. To confer, converse and otherwise hob-nob with my brother wizards. And I hereby decree that until what time, if any, that I return, the Scarecrow by virtue of his highly superior brains, shall rule in my stead, assisted by the Tin Man, by virtue of his magnificent heart, and the Lion by virtue of his courage! Obey them as you would me. Dorothy Oh, Toto - come back! Toto! Toto! Oh, don't go without me! I'll be right back! Toto! Tin Man Stop that dog! Dorothy Oh, come back, come back, don't go without me! Please, come back! Wizard I can't come back! I don't know how it works! Goodbye, folks! People of Oz Peope of OZ Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! Dorothy Oh, now I'll never get home! Lion Stay with us, then, Dorothy. We all love you. We don't want you to go. Dorothy Oh, that's very kind of you, but this could never be like Kansas. Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now. Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do? Scarecrow Look! Here's someone who can help you. Dorothy Oh - will you help me? Can you help me? Glinda You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas. Dorothy I have? Scarecrow Then why didn't you tell her before? Glinda Because she wouldn't have believed me. She had to learn it for herself. Tin Man What have you learned, Dorothy? Dorothy Well, I - I think that it - that it wasn't enough just to want to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em. And that it's that - if I ever go looking for my heart's desire again, I won't look any further than my own backyard, because if it isn't there, I never really lost it to begin with. Is that right? Glinda That's all it is! Glinda Are you ready now? Dorothy Yes. Say goodbye, Toto. Yes, I'm ready now. Glinda Then close your eyes and think to yourself 'There's no place like home. There's no place like home.' Dorothy and Glinda 'There's no place like home. There's no place like home.'"
